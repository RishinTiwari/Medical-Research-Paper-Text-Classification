# Cancer Document Classifier

## Description

The Cancer Document Classifier is a text classification project aimed at automatically categorizing cancer-related research papers into one of three categories: Thyroid Cancer, Colon Cancer, or Lung Cancer. The dataset comprises biomedical text documents focusing on long research papers with page sizes exceeding 6 pages. With a total of 7,569 publications, the dataset is labeled with three class labels representing the different types of cancer.

## Dataset Overview

- **Total Publications:** 7,569
- **Class Labels:** Thyroid Cancer, Colon Cancer, Lung Cancer
- **Number of Samples in Each Category:**
  - Colon Cancer: 2,579
  - Lung Cancer: 2,180
  - Thyroid Cancer: 2,810

## Project Objectives

1. Develop a text classifier capable of accurately categorizing cancer-related research papers into one of the three specified categories.
2. Explore and analyze the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of cancer-related research topics.
3. Implement machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to preprocess and classify the text data.
4. Evaluate the performance of the classifier using appropriate metrics and techniques, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Provide documentation and insights into the classification results, highlighting any notable findings or challenges encountered during the project.

## Project Components

1. **Data Collection:** Obtain the cancer-related research papers dataset from a reliable source or repository.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean, tokenize, and preprocess the text data to prepare it for classification.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features from the text data using techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization.
4. **Model Training:** Train machine learning models, such as logistic regression, support vector machines, or neural networks, on the preprocessed text data.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained models using cross-validation and appropriate evaluation metrics.
6. **Model Deployment:** Deploy the trained classifier in a suitable environment for real-world use, such as a web application or API.
